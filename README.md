# Indian States
* Inspired by Sporcle's "Can you name the US states?" quiz.
* This is a remake of the same quiz but modified for Indian states.
* A blank map of India will be displayed and user will be asked to type a state name.
* If the state name matches with any of the states of India, the name of that state gets pointed on the blank map.
* And in this way the user keeps on guessing untill all the 28 states has been named correctly and pointed on the map.
* This application can be used as a great educational tool for quickly learning the names and location of all the 28 Indian states.

### Standalone executable for Mac and Windows coming soon . . .
